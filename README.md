This application connects to Elasticsearch Machine Learning API running on localhost to retrieve the top forecast states that will have the lowest HPI rates.  It populates those results to a USA map.

See the data folder which contains HPI rates for states from 1992 - now.  It also contains the anomily ML JSON feed that can be used to implement into kibana.

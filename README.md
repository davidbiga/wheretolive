Hackmidwest - Best Machine Learning Application

This application is used to connect to Elasticsearch Machine Learning API to retrieve the top forecasters for lowest states to live in.  It populates those results to a USA map.

The data was fed from data.gov - 1992-now HPI state csv.  If you'd like help on running this locally, please reach out at biga.david@gmail.com
